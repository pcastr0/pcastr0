# Hello friend 👋, I'm Patrick Castro! 🤖

## 💻 About Me

I am a Software Engineer with extensive experience in building/supporting cloud-native applications and headless/composable commerce architectures. I have a strong focus on Backend Engineering, DevOps practices, observability, monitoring and Automation mindset. I am deeply passionate about diving deep on Traditional/Modern/Hybrid-Cloud Systems Design and Infrastructure Engineering. I've always loved operating sysyems... I occasionaly checkout different flavors of "distros", I'm a true believer in the unix philosophy, that's why in general I've always enjoyed using "unix" like operating systems as my main daily driver since on that space I feel most productive. Lately I've got my passion back on experimenting with computer hardware but only if time and money permits 😅. I thrive on working/supporting on innovative projects and am eager to contribute to open-source communities that peaks my interest in Technologies.
